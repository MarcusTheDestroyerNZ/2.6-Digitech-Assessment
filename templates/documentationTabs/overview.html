                        <p>I used functions to avoid repeating the same code. For example, power, research, and drawing on the screen are each handled in their own parts.</p>
                        <p>Key things like <code>research_upgrades()</code> and <code>building_stats()</code> made the game easier to manage and grow.</p>
                        <p>The game's code is built in layers. The main loop uses other functions to handle everything, like <code>update_power()</code> managing timers, repairs, and limits all at once. This keeps things neat and makes it easier to change or fix stuff.</p>
                        <p>Game logic (how things work) is separate from UI (how things look), which makes it easier to test and update parts without breaking others.</p>

                        <p>While building the game, I ran into some issues and fixed them by testing and trying different things:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                            <li><strong>Offline rewards:</strong> I made sure the game couldn't be tricked by changing the clock. If it sees a future time, it resets the reward timer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Research tree:</strong> It was hard to keep the lines between upgrades in the right place, so I used special data setups and zoom scaling to fix it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Broken save files:</strong> Sometimes the save was empty or half-done. I used try/except to stop it crashing and start a new save if needed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Balancing:</strong> Some upgrades were way too strong. I wrote a testing script to see how much they gave over time, then fixed the numbers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Through all this, I learned how useful it is to reuse code, make backups, and test things in small chunks before adding them to the main project.</p>
