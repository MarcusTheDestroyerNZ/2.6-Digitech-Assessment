                                In this code I have a function called <code>save_player_data()</code> that saves the player's data into a JSON file. 
                                <br>
                                This saves all important player information, such as money, research, power, upgrades, and the state of the game world (like placed blocks and unlocked areas) into a file for loading next time the game is opened. 
                                <br>
                                It writes this data to <code>playerData.json</code> using the <code>json.dump()</code>.
                                <br>
                                I use the <code>now.strftime()</code> method to get the current date and time when the player logs out, which is also saved in the JSON file. I use this to track when the player last played the game, giving offline progress when they return.
