                    This environmental game was inspired by my work on the AS91890 assessment.
                    During that examination, I explored concepts about environmental sustainability
                    and realized there was an opportunity to transform those ideas into an
                    interactive learning experience.

                <h2 class="card-title">Why This Game?</h2>
                <p>
                    The assessment helped me understand the importance of environmental education,
                    and I wanted to create something that would make learning about environmental
                    issues both fun and engaging. By turning these concepts into a game, players
                    can learn about environmental challenges while actively participating in solutions.

                    What started as theoretical work in AS91890 has evolved into this interactive game.
                    The project combines educational content with gaming elements to create an engaging
                    experience that promotes environmental awareness and understanding.
